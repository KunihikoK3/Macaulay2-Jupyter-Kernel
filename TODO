Easy:

    ☐ package as pip package
    ☐ fix screenshot (50,270 - 1000,490)
    ☐ enable raw cell magic
    ☐ include caveats (in the documentation)
    ☐ "M2JK" vs "IM2"
    ☐ test package includes
    ☐ test loading an m2 file
    ☐ test exporting an m2 file

Medium:

    ☐ write wiki documentation
    ☐ make a release as version 0.1.0
    ☐ write codemirror/lexer for M2
    ☐ see if you can do travis-ci for macaulay2 (probably not worth the effort)

Hard/Big:

    ☐ run M2 thru Python
    ☐ "try it online"
