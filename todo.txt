Easy

- package as pip package
- enable raw cell magic
- include caveats (in the documentation)
- "M2JK" vs "IM2"
- add documentation banner
- see if you can do travis-ci for macaulay2 (probably not worth the effort)
- test package includes
- test loading an m2 file
- test exporting an m2 file

Medium

- finish documentation
- export sphinx theme
- make a release as version 0.1.0
- fix sphinx rendering
- write codemirror/lexer for M2

Hard/Big

- run M2 thru Python
- "try it online"
