# M2JK

You can now use [Jupyter](http://www.jupyter.org) (Notebook or Lab) as a front-end for Macaulay2.
It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Emacs,
but introduces far more powerful features, like
logical organization of the code into cells and in-line Markdown with TeX,
to name just a couple.

Find a complete (and pretty-looking) documentation, check out the RTFD entry [here](m2jk.rtfd.io).
