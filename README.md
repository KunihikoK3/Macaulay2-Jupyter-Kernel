# M2JK

You can now use [Jupyter](http://www.jupyter.org) (Notebook or Lab) as a front-end for [Macaulay2](http://faculty.math.illinois.edu/Macaulay2/).
It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Emacs,
but introduces far more powerful features like
logical organization of the code into cells and in-line Markdown with TeX,
to name just a couple.

For details, check out the [documentation](http://m2jk.rtfd.io).
For bugs or requests, open an issue.
For recent changes, see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Examples

You can see the full version of the screenshot [here](https://raw.github.com/radoslavraynov/Macaulay2-Jupyter-Kernel/master/demo/sample.png).
Github renders notebooks directly (if slightly off). The examples below highlight some of the power:

* [sample](#) (the notebook in the screenshot)
* [the book](#)
* [new codeing style](#)

## Installation

The prerequisites are just Jupyter and Macaulay2.
Note that the former runs on either Python version 2 and 3, but we require version 3.6+.

This software is not part of Macaualay2 and is released under the MIT License.
