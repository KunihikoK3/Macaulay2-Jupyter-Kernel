# M2JK

You can now use [Jupyter](http://www.jupyter.org) (Notebook or Lab) as a front-end for [Macaulay2](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/Macaulay2/).
It can be used as a drop-in replacement for Emacs,
but introduces far more powerful features, like
logical organization of the code into cells and in-line Markdown with TeX,
to name just a couple.

For details, check out the [documentation](http://m2jk.rtfd.io) on rtfd.io.
